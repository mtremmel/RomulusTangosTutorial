    "    - ColdGasMass_encl (cold gas mass enclosed by different radii. use the at() function for this)\n",

    "2) look back at the tangos_intro notebook. based on some of the properties you've made scatter plots for in this notebook and in that one (e.g. mdot-sfr, mstar-mhalo, etc) pick some galaxies to look at in more detail. Look at their images and their time evolution and star formation histories."
