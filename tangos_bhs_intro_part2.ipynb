One complication with this process is that the new black hole inherits the ID number of one of the two black holes. The other black hole is essentially removed from the simulation. This is in part why tracing individual black holes is not always the right answer. When a merger occurs, it is never certain which BH is the \"correct\" one to follow (remember, the ID numbers are essentialy meaningless). Do you follow the one that was in the center previously?
